# model_window
easily create new windows and switch between those windows
This code creates a window named root using tkinter. The user can switch between two windows called first_window and second_window. While the root is not destroyed, the frame inside the window is destoyed and rebuilt each time the user presses the button on the bottom left. 
There is a bit of an issue with the mouse scroll. It will move improperly when the page is not filled with widgets.
